			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Mr. Ayers, your classes have always been some of the most stimulating, enjoyable classes I could have had. Having been taught by you for almost
			every year I was at Ridgeview, you have taught me unforgettable life lessons that I will keep in mind throughout my time in college. Having been able to be a part
			of such a well-taught and productive Greek class has given me a sense of pride I could not have attained anywhere else in the Ridgeview curriculum. I sincerely hope
			that you continue to have strong, educated opinions and always argue with your (more belligerent) students the same way you did with me.</p>
